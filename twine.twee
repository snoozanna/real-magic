<p class="bold">Well, hello. Shw’mae! Welcome</p>

<p>I’m Phyl, an actor who’s been coming to this wonderful theatre for <i>years</i>. </p>

<p>I’ve been in plays like <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i> and <i>The Government Inspector</i>.</p>

<p>You might have even seen my Bottom – in Shakespeare, I mean! </p>

<p>But I’m best known for Theatr Clwyd’s rock and roll pantos – playing the Dame.</p>

<p>One minute – let me summon her up... “Hiya - Looking lush, loves!” There she is!</p>

<p>Now I’m here today as I have been asked to be the voice of this heritage tour – called ‘Real Magic’...</p>

<p>I don’t know entirely what ‘Real Magic’ means, but we will find out together, I imagine.</p>

<p>I’ll also be translating for non-Welsh speakers as we go along. Adderchog! That’s ‘Excellent’’ in Welsh.</p>

<p>But first, let’s make sure everyone – myself included – understands how this tour will work. </p>

<p>There are buttons on your screen to move us to the next page ... let’s give that a go. </p>

<p class="bold">That’s Christine Langton – wife of the late Maurice Langton – who in 1975 got the job to design and manage where you are now: Theatr Clwyd’s old TV studio.  </p>
<p>It’s a huge, soundproofed room, with very high ceilings. Hanging from the ceiling is the lighting grid, which still has many of the old numbers and details. The bars are boxy and dark grey and I can imagine heavy lights hanging from them, filling the room with a strange buzz.  </p>
<p>This is actually part of what was a pantograph system - which would have channeled electricity into the room, powering the lights, and the systems, everything that was used to make the TV shows here. </p> 
<p>It’s changed now - but the bars are what would have made everything possible. </p>

<div class="quote"><p>"The studio complex became an object of pride, really, for that area...TV was actually made from Mold. In the village that I lived in. People were dumbfounded by the idea that there was a television station studio down the road, and they were delighted, actually. So, oh, this, this actually means something to us." </p></div>

<p>That’s John Hunter – a TV director and producer, who worked here as an HTV cameraman. </p>

<p class="bold">Then it became Studio 2 – a home in North Wales for two TV channels that mean a lot to Welsh people – HTV and S4C. </p>

<p>They created music programmes, chat shows and quizzes, with audiences bussed in by the coachload. The beloved Welsh-language children’s programme Ffalabalam – and its beautiful sets, full of little houses and toys – was made here, too.</p> 


<div class="quote"><p class="bold">"Ffalabalam was a completely charming children's programme. It was, it was a beauty of a programme and I don't know why it ended to be honest. A small village as one imagines, such as the miniature villages one gets in the Cotswolds etc. The set was amazing with dolls and teddies and to tell the truth, they were the characters, except that we as presenters kind of understood them talking even though they didn't say anything and we conveyed the programme through that."</p></div>

<p>Thanks Loz. When HTV left in the 1990s, it transformed again. Plays were workshopped, rehearsed, and even staged here – including a brilliant programme by schools called TYP – Theatre for Young People. That’s what I know this room as mostly – many hours practicing lines, dance numbers, quick costume changes...</p>

<p>This one room has been so many different places – it keeps adapting. The community of Theatr Clwyd shapes what comes next, and it’s all led to you being here too. Marvelous. </p>

<p>Magic is an act of transformation, isn’t it? I’ve played many magical panto characters, so I should know. Things can change form and shape here at Theatr Clwyd, without losing the energy and passion they had at the very beginning. That’s something very precious. </p>

<p>Next, we are off to one of the hidden gems of Theatr Clwyd. </p>

<p>I’ll lead you there – first up head back to the bar. </p>

<p class="bold">This paintframe is one of a handful remaining in the UK – and very few of those are operational, let alone located in the theatre itself. </p>
<p>Terry Hands, who was Artistic Director here from the 1990s to the mid 2010s, had a lot to do with Theatr Clwyd’s paintframe staying on site – </p>

<div class="quote"><p>“The biggest legacy that Terry left was that we had all of the making departments in-house. He fought tooth and nail. It’s one of our USPs – and that it's one of very few theatres in the in the UK, and yet we're outside a small market town in North East Wales, and we've got all of...that!”</p></div>

<p>That’s Liam Evans-Ford, who became Executive Director at Theatr Clwyd in 2016. He’s someone who, like Terry Hands, has fought tooth and nail for the theatre and particularly the building’s redevelopment.</p>

<p>There’s been a history of battlers at Theatr Clwyd. But this stuff is important. An on-site workshop means the theatre can employ people locally, to build an incredible crew, who make sets right here, which is such a privilege. </p>

<p>There are indeed paint stains everywhere, Angharad – and if you think, each dash of paint in here will have been made as part of a production or event to connect with someone. My favourite part is the sink – it is absolutely covered in paint – Layer upon layer. It’s a work of art. </p>

   <p> So this gauze is from our Christmas pantomime from Beauty and the Beast in 2021. The cloth you see is a transformation gauze, different to a normal scenic canvas cloth. We've painted it in dark blues and ultramarine and Prussian colours. There's a large offset silver and gold star and radiating from it is a trail of iridescent bubbles.</p>

<p>The bubbles increase in size as they get further away from the star. Each bubble is individually painted with reflective light and glittered with iridescent glitter. The magic of the transformation gauze is that depending on the way it is lit, it can look solid and at other times see-through. This is achieved by a high level of light directed to the face of the gauze.</p>

<p>If this light is taken away and redirected to something behind the gauze, such as the actors or a different scene, the image on the gauze, in this instance the bubbles and the star, will completely disappear and reveal the scene behind, just like magic.</p>

<p>So this cloth was painted in four days and then taken down and put on the workshop floor for the final day. This allowed us to glitter it flat. It's very difficult to glitter it upright so doing it on the flat is the best way of doing it.</p>

<p class="bold">There’s something special back here – sometimes overlooked. </p>
<p>The craft that is baked into every story we tell is rustled up in the workshop, on the paint frame, backstage. The rock and roll pantos we make are very special – they are huge and ambitious. They push our making teams to the max! The pantos mean so much to us at Theatr Clwyd and to all our audiences. I became the Dame in 2003 – with my wigs, fancy frocks, and musical instruments in tow – I’ve played the trombone, saxophone, flute, god knows what else, even a cowbell. Our pantos are like nothing else –  Our pantos are like nothing else – </p>

<p>You might notice the amazing red tiles which line the walls. They have beautiful curved edges, and look almost like bricks. I love looking out at them when I’m on stage.

<p>Every tile looks slightly different. When they were fired in their kilns, each responded differently to the flames, revealing distinct patterns and colours. Theatre experts also helped with their fitting – they knew the effect the tiles would have on the theatre’s sound.</p>

<p>Ah! Here is someone who lived near Mold. <br>
    He was recruited from school to be in a play when he was 10 – he’d  never even seen a play before!  <br>
    And he went on to work in Hollywood – Rhys Ifans.

    <p>"The first time I performed on the main stage in Theatr Clwyd  was a Theatr Clwyd production of Toad, of Toad Hall, and I played a rat and I played a weasel, and it changed my life. </p>
    
    <p>Being on the stage was fantastic, because I loved the fact that you were aware of the audience, but couldn't really see them. I loved the kind of the amount of light that was on me, not in the sense that I felt seen. I just couldn't believe that, just the warmth it felt like walking into sunshine. And also the sense that when you step on stage, you set something in motion, and you have to let it run its course. You know what I mean, you can't step in and with doubts, or with, you know, say, Oh, I don't want to do this. I'm tired. You have to almost... it was... going with the flow. And you had to, like you had to succumb to the gravity of the audience and that relationship with you and it."</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The first time I remember going to Theatr Clwyd was when I was in a production of Oliver when I was around 15 and I remember being on stage and it was total magic. It’s an amazing theatre and I’ve been very fortunate growing up in Mold. So later on, I was part of a group called Cwmni 25 and I did a lot of workshops for young people during the summer.</p>

<p>With Cwmni 25, run by Gwennan Mair Jones, I was really lucky that she was running the sessions bilingually, naturally bilingually, so that was my first introduction to the Welsh arts scene.</p>

</div>

<p>That’s Isabella Colby Browne – another actor from Mold – she first performed in a production of Oliver on the stage when she was 15. Thanks to a group called Cwmni 25, run by Gwennan Mair Jones. She went on to perform in Welsh and English! Da iawn Isabella. </p>

So I want to thank everybody that’s gone out of their way to make me comfortable, knowing that Mags was in a safe environment and then able to do my job...</p>

<p>One of my lasting memories will always be, during a break of the  Robin Hood panto. I was dressed as Wonder Woman and, during the interval, there’s a picture of me pushing Mags into the toilet, me dressed as Wonder Woman and her in her wheelchair, you know. And we were both laughing, you know.. And that's what you get. Whatever problems you've got, they will look after you in Theatr Clwyd. They will go the extra mile. They really will."</p>

<p class="bold">Theatr Clwyd’s mission statement begins like this:</p>

<p><b><i>Once upon a time a group of people stood on a hill<br/>
 and decided to make the world a happier place.</i>
    </b>
</p>

<p>Today, in this beautiful building, people continue that legacy – and keep imagining amazing new ways to keep that vision going.</p>

<div class="quote"><p>“It’s always had a spirit of adventure, I think Theatr Clwyd. It's never sat back on its laurels and gone, oh, we're going to play everything safe. It's never done that, and it’s all the better for it, I think.”</p></div>
<p>That’s Emyr John, an amazing creative associate, running programmes welcoming young people from a huge variety of different backgrounds. His work ranges from an LGBTQ group, to history talks, to storytelling workshops for all ages...</p>

<div class="quote"><p>“The theatre staff were very, very helpful. They did all the lighting for us... our own stage manager who was coached by their stage manager, which was excellent... They were absolutely fantastic..”</p></div>
<p>That’s Gina. She was a new mum in the mid-1970s, when she set up the Dee and Alyn Gilbert and Sullivan Society. Haydn Rees invited her to stage a production in Theatr Clwyd’s opening week. </p>
<div class="quote"><p>Theatr Clwyd... for me, personally, it's always given me and reminded me of a quiet courage. And I think at its best. That's what it does for an audience, too. You know, in all its shapes, there's always a component in it that has to do with courage... It's empowering.</p></div>
<p>That’s Rhys again.</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“The staff were so patient and kind to all the members with disabilities, and everyone else too..it gave us that, that lift-off really..."</p></div>
<p>That’s Catherine Pugh, who co-founded the musical theatre group, Buzz-Ah. The group developed a variety of skills for disabled and non-disabled people and staged lots of productions in our main theatre...</p>

<p>And this is Tamara Harvey, she was Theatr Clwyd’s artistic director from 2015 to 2022. She went on to be Co-Artistic director at the Royal Shakespeare Company.  </p>

<div class="quote">
<p>“I think what's extraordinary about it is that it shouldn't exist. It's kind of beautiful madness that it does. It exists because of the passion and tenacity and dedication and vision of a group of people in the 1970s who said our community deserve a voice and then continues to exist because of the passion and vision and tenacity and dedication of continuing groups of people through its history and and so there is a kind of a defiance to it.”  
    </p>
</div>
<p>Theatr Clwyd is not one thing. </p>
<p>A group of people stood on the hill, and then another group of people stood on a hill, and then another. They all imagined a better world, and with Theatr Clwyd they made it. Theatr Clwyd doesn’t exist because a group of people imagined, but because people kept on imagining, and will keep on imagining too...</p>

<p>That’s the real magic of Theatr Clwyd. <br>
Where new realities are imagined, crafted and created. <br>
Where we understand our past as a story of transformation that continues into our future. <br>
Where our community shapes us, challenges us, and drives us on – from the bees on our roofs, to the people standing on the hill, looking out and imagining something new.</p>
