<p>Over the trail there will be audio to listen to, and visuals and text to look at. </p>

<p>We recommend using headphones, but you can play out loud if you’re in a group. Don’t worry, there are headphones available at the Box Office, if you didn’t bring some with you. </p>

<p>There is WiFi available throughout the building - it’s called X - you can connect to that if you’d prefer.</p> 

<p>We’d recommend getting the sound and brightness on your phone right before we move on - it makes everything smoother. When you are ready, find somewhere comfy in the foyer, and click the button below, then I’ll get us started.  </p>

<p>I’m here today as I have been asked to be the voice of this new heritage tour called ‘Real Magic’...</p>

<p>I don’t know entirely what Real Magic means, but we will find out together, I imagine.</p>

<p>I’ll also be translating for non-Welsh speakers as we go along. Adderchog! That’s ‘Excellent’’ in Welsh.</p>

<p>But first, let’s make sure everyone - myself included - understands how this tour will work. </p>

<p>“Haydn Rees had retired by the time I was there, but I was summoned to meet with him. He gave me the story of…how he achieved Theatr Clwyd, against all the odds.”</p>
<p>“He simply said, the people of Clwyd should have access to the best of everything, and I will ensure that they do. And so the County Arts Centre, as he called it, initially, was the crowning glory at the top of hill, this civic site. A symbol of confidence, of intent...”</p>
<p>“And as the architects explained to me... most buildings in urban areas, the site is constrained in some way. But there was this site at the top of the hill …there was nothing to constrain the size or the architectural design of the theatre.” </p></div>
<p class="bold">
Haydn Rees is a Theatr Clwyd legend. </p>
<p>A county council boss who visited arts centres across Europe with his team in the late 1960s. He returned determined to build an even more brilliant one for the people of Mold.</p> 

<p>Without Haydn Rees there would be no story of Theatr Clwyd to tell - so it really is the best place to start. </p>

<p>I like this spot - from here you might be able to see the 70s cream tiles, which mark the outer wall of the original theatre. Where the old meets the new. </p>

<p>You might be a long time visitor here or this might be your first time - Theatr Clwyd has always been known for being welcoming to all. Well, that’s what my wife Mags always thought.  </p>

<p>The new extension has more glass and lovely light. Move now towards the view - you can look out through the windows , or go out to the balcony if you’d like.</p>

<p class="bold">They were looking up to the theatre and we are facing out to an incredible view. </p>
<p>Ahead there are the beautiful Clwydian hills, including their highest point, the Moel Famau mountain, to the right. The shops, stalls and streets of Mold town centre are about a mile away, tucked away into the land. </p>

<p>This is where the dream of Theatr Clwyd began. </p>
<p>Haydn Rees stood on this hill, and looked at this view with his colleagues in the late 1960s.</p>  

<p>They dreamt about how civic duty – society working together – could improve everyone’s wellbeing. They believed that the arts could really change local lives. That the arts could give people more. They imagined a building that would make that dream possible. </p>

<p>
 <b>
     <i>
        Once upon a time a group of people stood on a hill<br/>
        and decided to make the world a happier place.
     </i>
 </b>
</p>
<p>That moment forms part of Theatr Clwyd’s mission statement, which guides the theatre now. </p>

<p>So she’s been inspired by the  beautiful view too – as well as the original bar tiles from the 1970s, and by the tiles in the  main Moondance theatre. </p>

<p>That’s the thing about that view - yes it invites us to imagine. But we don’t leave what we imagined there, in the skies, we take it with us. The dream follows us back into the theatre - it shapes what we do. </p>

<div class="quote"><p>I do think people wondered what, why theres this theatre and television studio were up the hill, you know, yes, I do think people wondered about that, but whoever had the vision, I think, had a wonderful, wonderful vision of what was to come.</p></div>
<p class="bold">That’s Christine Langton – wife of the late Maurice Langton, who got the job to design and manage where you are now in 1975, and this is Theatr Clwyd’s old TV studio. </p>
<p>It’s a huge, soundproofed room, with very high ceilings. Hanging from the ceiling is the lighting grid, which still has many of the old numbers and details. The bars are boxy and dark grey and I can imagine heavy lights hanging from them, filling the room with a strange buzz.  </p>
<p>This is actually part of what was a pantograph system - which would have channeled electricity into the room, powering the lights, and the systems, everything that was used to make the TV shows here. </p> 
<p>It’s changed now - but the bars are what would have made everything possible. </p>

<div class="quote"><p>The studio complex became an object of pride, really, for that area...TV was actually made from Mold. In the village that I lived in. People were dumbfounded by the idea that there was a television station studio down the road, and they were delighted, actually. So, oh, this, this actually means something to us. </p></div>

<p>That’s John Hunter - a TV director and producer who worked here as a HTV cameraman. This room has had quite a history. </p>

<p>It began life as part of an education technology centre for schools, where local young people could make films – imagine doing that in the 1970s! </p>

<p>Then it became Studio 2 – a home in North Wales for two TV channels that mean a lot to Welsh people – HTV and S4C. </p>

<p>Music programmes, chat shows and quizzes were made here, with audiences bussed in by the coachload. So was a beloved Welsh language children’s programme, Ffalabalam – its beautiful sets, full of little houses and toys, were made here, too.</p>

<div class="quote"><p class="bold">Ffalabalam was a completely charming children's programme. It was, it was a beauty of a programme and I don't know why it ended to be honest. A small village as one imagines, such as the miniature villages one gets in the Cotswolds etc. The set was amazing with dolls and teddies and to tell the truth, they were the characters, except that we as presenters kind of understood them talking even though they didn't say anything and we conveyed the programme through that.</p></div>

<p>That’s Welsh TV royalty Caryl Parry Jones - a singer, actor and she was a presenter at HTV and S4C - and clearly a fan of Ffalabalam.</p>

<p>Thanks Loz. When HTV left in the 2990s, this space didn’t die. It transformed again. Plays were workshopped, rehearsed, and even staged here – including a brilliant programme by schools called TYP - Theatre for Young People. That’s what I know this room as mostly - many hours practicing lines, dance numbers, quick costume changes...</p>

<p> This one room has been so many different places.  It kept adapting. It keeps adapting. The community of Theatr Clwyd shapes what comes next. And it’s all led to you being here too. Marvelous. </p>

<p>Magic is an act of transformation, isn’t it? I’ve played many a fairy in panto so I should know. Things can change form and shape here at Theatr Clwyd, without losing the energy and passion they had at the very beginning. That’s something very precious. </p>

<p class="bold">This paintframe is one of less than 20 remaining in the UK – and very few of those are operational, let alone located in the theatre itself.</p>
 <p>Terry Hands, who was Artistic Director here from the 1990s to the mid 2010s, had a lot to do with that. </p>

<div class="quote"><p>“The biggest legacy that Terry left was that we had all of the making departments in-house. He fought tooth and nail. It’s one of our USPs – and that it's one of very few theatres in the in the UK, and yet we're outside a small market town in North East Wales, and we've got all of...that!”</p></div>

<p>That’s Liam Evans-Ford, Executive Director. He’s someone who, like Terry Hands, has fought tooth and nail for the theatre and particularly the building’s redevelopment.</p>

<p>There’s been a history of battlers here. But this stuff is important. An on-site workshop means the theatre can employ people locally, and make sets right here, which is such a privilege. </p>

<p>There are indeed paint stains everywhere, Angharad - and if you think each dash of paint in here will have been made to be part of a production or event to connect with someone. My favourite part is the sink - it is absolutely covered in paint - Layer upon layer. It’s a work of art. </p>
<p>Talking about works of art, let’s see some that have been made here. </p>
<p>You might notice a long piece of fabric on the balcony - this was made on the paint frame and designed by Adrian Gee.. </p>

<p>The craft that is baked into every story we tell is rustled up in the workshop, on the paint frame, backstage. The rock and roll pantos we make are very special and mean a lot to us and to all our audiences. I became the Dame in 2003 – with my wigs, fancy frocks, and musical instruments in tow – I've played the trombone, saxophone, flute, god knows what else, on stage. Our pantos are like nothing else -</p>

<p class="bold">These are Transform tiles from the 1970s – based on a design by German sculptor, Fritz Steller.</p>
<p>He made incredible art for civic buildings across the UK.</p>
<p> Each tile looks slightly different because when they were fired in their kilns, each responded differently to the flames, revealing distinct patterns and colours. Theatre experts also helped with their fitting – they knew the effect the tiles would have on the theatre's sound.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>It's a fascinating space…it enables you to do what you want with it, sonically, from a sound point of view.</p>

<p>It always felt very intimate. Always felt like...if you wanted to, and if you, you know, were confident enough of what you were doing, you had the audience that right there...and acoustically, too. Vocally was always kind of easy to play, really, compared with so many places I played.</p>

<p>That's Steffan Rhodri, he's performed on this stage countless times and you might recognise him from a little known British sitcom!</p>

<p class="bold">Onstage, there are lights above and the audience below, with the world of the play alive all around you.  </p>

<p>Ah! Here is someone who lived near Mold. </p>
<p>He was recruited from school to be in a play when he was 10 – he’d  never even seen a play before! – </p>
<p>And now he’s in Hollywood – Rhys Ifans.</p>


<div class="quote">
    <p>The first time I performed on the main stage in Theatr Clwyd  was a Theatr Clwyd production of Toad, of Toad Hall, and I played a rat and I played a weasel, and it changed my life. </p>
    
    <p>Being on the stage was fantastic, because I loved the fact that you were aware of the audience, but couldn't really see them. I loved the kind of the amount of light that was on me, not in the sense that I felt seen. I just couldn't believe that, just the warmth it felt like walking into sunshine. and also the sense that when you step on stage, you set something in motion, and you have to let it run its course. You know what I mean, you can't step in and with doubts, or with, you know, say, Oh, I don't want to do this. I'm tired. You have to almost... it was... going with the flow. And you had to, like you had to succumb to the gravity of the audience and that relationship with you and it.</p>

<p>And now he’s in Hollywood – Rhys Ifans.</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>The first time I remember going to Theatr Clwyd was when I was in a production of Oliver when I was around 15 and I remember being on stage and it was total magic. It’s an amazing theatre and I’ve been very fortunate growing up in Mold. So later on, I was part of a group called Cwmni 25 and I did a lot of workshops for young people during the summer. </p>
    
</div>

<p>That’s Isabella Colby Browne  - another actor from Mold - she first performed in a production of Oliver on the stage when she was 15 - and thanks to a group called Cwmni 25, run by Gewennan Mair Jones, she now performs in Welsh and English! Da iawn Isabella</p>

<p class="bold">From the front row, the stage is right in front of you, only  inches up.  </p>
<div class="quote"><p>“It's total immersion from the front row”</p></div>
<p>That’s Judie von der Fecht! Her and Paul are front row regulars.</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“Our first date was going to see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on stage at Theatr Clwyd...”</p></div>
<p>There’s Paul! They’ve been coming here since the late 1970s. They’ve been to - how many productions?</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“Hundreds and hundreds…I’ve always said that if we ever win the lottery- ... we're going to have a theatre room. And we're going to wallpaper it with our tickets.”</p></div>

<div class="quote"><p>“The main theatre is so wonderfully intimate. No matter where you sit. It doesn't feel like when you go in there to sit down, it feels enormous, but as soon as stuff is happening on stage, there's no bad seat there... you feel so intimate. I guess it's a place of escape, almost, that it's one of the few places where I would go in and sit down and think, Well, whatever happens, this is going to be brilliant.” </p></div>
<p class="bold">That’s Megan Price. Her parents worked here from the 70s – she was the first Theatr Clwyd baby!<p> 
<p>and she grew up in our youth theatre. She now works as a freelance arts marketing specialist. </p>

:: 46_floorplan_story [nobr]
<p class="bold">The ushers often sneak in to sit here – and see a play changing through the weeks.</p>

<p>Ah, it’s our usher Geoff Wiliams again!</p>

<div class="quote"><p>“You could look at the whole stage and the performance in a different way. You could see things that were going on that you never noticed because you were too busy watching the overall picture. And to watch a thing two or three times, it isn't boring, it's terrific.”</p></div>

    <p>My lovely wife, Mags, was with me up here for my pantos in the last five years. She wasn’t well, and in a wheelchair, but she was looked after by the team when I was performing,  treated with such love by everyone – looked after like she was one of the cast.”</p>

I have a picture of me taken by the team, pushing Mags, in her wheelchair, into the toilets. We were both laughing, you know.. And that's what you get here.

<p class="bold">Theatr Clwyd’s mission statement begins like this:</p>

<p>
    <b>
        <i>Once upon a time a group of people stood on a hill<br/>
        and decided to make the world a happier place.</i>
    </b>
</p>

<p>Today, in this beautiful building, people continue that legacy – and keep imagining amazing new ways to keep that vision going.</p>

<div class="quote"><p>“It’s always had a spirit of adventure, I think Theatr Clwyd. It's never sat back on its laurels and gone, oh, we're going to play everything safe. It's never done that, and it’s all the better for it, I think.”</p></div>
<p>That’s Emyr John, one of our amazing creative associates – he runs programmes welcoming young people from a huge variety of different backgrounds, he runs an LGBTQ group, gives history talks, does storytelling workshops for all ages...</p>

<div class="quote"><p>“The theatre staff were very, very helpful. They did all the lighting for us... our own stage manager who was coached by their stage manager, which was excellent... They were absolutely fantastic..”</p></div>
<p>That’s Gina, she was a new mum in the mid-1970s, when she set up the Dee and Alyn Gilbert and Sullivan Society. Haydn Rees invited her to stage a production in Theatr Clwyd’s opening week. </p>
<div class="quote"><p>TheatrClwyd...for me, personally, it's always given me and reminded me of a quiet courage. And I think at its best. That's what it does for an audience, too. You know, in all its shapes, there's always a component in it that has to do with courage... It's empowering.</p></div>
<p>That’s Rhys again</p>
<div class="quote"><p>“The staff were so patient and kind, um, to all the members with disabilities, and everyone else too..it gave us that, that lift-off really..."</p></div>
<p>That’s Catherine Pugh, who co-founded the musical theatre group, Buzz-Ah, who developed a variety of skills for people with or without disabilities and staged lots of productions in our main theatre...</p>

<p>And this is Tamara - Tamara Harvey, she was Theatr Clwyd’s artistic director from 2015 to 2022, and  now co-runs the Royal Shakespeare Company  – </p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>
        “I think what's extraordinary about it is that it shouldn't exist. It it's kind of beautiful madness that it does. It exists because of the passion and tenacity and dedication and vision of a group of people in the 1970s who said our community deserve a voice and then continues to exist because of the passion and vision and tenacity and dedication of continuing groups of people through its history and and so there is a kind of a defiance to it.” 
        
    </p>
</div>
<p>Theatr Clwyd is not one thing. </p>
<p>A group of people stood on the hill, and then another group of people stood on a hill, and then another. They all imagined a better world, and with Theatr Clwyd they made it. Theatr Clwyd doesn’t exist because a group of people imagined, but because people kept on imagining, and will keep on imagining too</p>

<p>That’s the real magic of Theatr Clwyd. <br/>
Where new realities are imagined, crafted and created <br/>
Where we understand our past as a story of transformation that continues into our future <br/>
Where our community shapes us, challenges us, and drives us on - from the bees on our roofs, to the people standing on the hill, looking out and imagining something new - you. <br/>
